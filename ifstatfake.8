.TH IFSTATFAKE "8" "April 2008" "ifstatfake" "Maintenance Commands"
.SH NAME
ifstatfake \- Manipulates the kernel's netdevive-driver's statistics.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ifstatfake [--help|--version]
.I iface
.B rx|tx
.I field amount
.SH DESCRIPTION
ifstatfake provides an interface to modify the statistics of the kernel's
netdevice drivers, which can be read from 
.I /proc/net/dev
or are printed by
.BR ifconfig (8).

This script utilises the ifstatfake-kernel module and it's file in the
proc-filesystem. It's purpose is to save some typing and avoid the
necessity for searching the system's logs for errors when something went
wrong.

If the module is not loaded, this script will try to load it.
First it'll look in the current directory for it and insmod it, if found.
If not, it'll try a modprobe for it.
If the module is loaded by this script, it'll be unloaded automatically.
