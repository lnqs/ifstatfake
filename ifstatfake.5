.SH NAME
ifstatfake \- Pseudo-file to manipulate the kernel's netdevice statistics
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I /proc/net/ifstatfake
is an interface to the kernel's network-device driver's statistics,
provided by the
.B ifstatfake
kernel-module.

It is a write-only file, which executes commands written to it to to
modify the statistics. This commands have to follow the syntax:
.IP
.I iface
.B rx|tx
.I field amount
.PP
The meanings of the options are:
.TP
.I iface
The name of the interface to change the statistics, i.e. eth0
.TP
.B rx, tx
Sets whether the statistics in context of received
(rx) or sent (tx) data should be changed
.TP
.I field
Which field should be changed. Possible values are:
.B bytes, packets, errs, drop, fifo, frame
(only with 'rx' set),
.B compressed, multicast
(only with 'rx' set),
.B colls
(only with 'tx' set) and
.B carrier
(only with 'tx' set)
.TP
.I amount
A number the
.I field
should be set to or a number to be
added or substracted from the current value with a
trailing
.B '=', '+'
or
.B '-'
to specify if the value should be set, added or substracted
.LP
For example,
.IP
.B echo eth0 rx drop +30 > /proc/net/ifstatfake
.PP
would increment the number of dropped, incoming ethernet-frames of the
interface eth0 by 30.

The file cannot be read.

.B ifstatfake (8)
utilizes
.I /proc/net/ifstatfake
and provides a more comfortable interface to it.
